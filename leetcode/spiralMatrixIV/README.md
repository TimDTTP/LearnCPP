# Problem
Given...
- An integer, m
- An integer, n
- A list node, head

Return...
- A vector<vector<int>>

Where...
The return value is a matrix size m by n, which contains the values of head in
clockwise spiral order, starting from top-left.

[\#2326 Spiral Matrix IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix-iv/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-09-09)

## Constraints
- 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
- 1 <= m * n <= 10^5
- Number of nodes in head is between [1, m*n]
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Approach
