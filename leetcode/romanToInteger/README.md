# Problem
Given a set of Roman numerals...
return an int

[\#13 Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

## Approaches
- Brute force? first to mind
1. Create a dictionary; numeral to value
2. Iterate through string
3. If str[i + 1] > str[i]; use subtraction
4. Else just add upon another

## Improvements
Wow, initial approach was already very similar to online proposed solutions!
