# Problem
Given...
- A vector of integers, `nums`
- An integer, `k`

Return...
- An integer

Where...
On any value in nums, you can change nums\[i] to any value between...
- nums\[i] - k 
Or
- nums\[i] + k

The 'beauty' of the array is the longest subsequence consisting of equal
elements. Note that you can only apply the operation once per index. A 
subsequence is any sequence that can be made by deleting some elements without
changing the order of the remaining elements.
