# Problem
Given...
- vector<\int>, rolls
- int, mean
- int, n

Return...
- vector<\int>

Where...
n is the number of missing observations. Return ONE possibility of values, in
an vector of values that could be missing. The values must be values 1-6 (on a
dice), and final observations must have an average of mean.

## Constraints
- m == rolls.length
- 1 <= n, m <= 10^5
- 1 <= rolls[\i], mean <= 6

## Approach
