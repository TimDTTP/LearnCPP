Problem #1 given from LearnCPP Chapter 10.X

In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters. Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that can be one of the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for this.

Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string or std::string_view), as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take before they die. Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members. Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list, and pass them to printMonster().
