Self-made problem involving LearnCPP chapter 10, "structs"

Create a program that continually asks for an employee's...
- First name
- Last name
- DOB in MM/DD/YYYY format
- Office position from a select list
Until "QUIT" is entered.

Have a function that automatically gives a unique ID to each member inputted. Lastly, when program ends, print out all the information inputted by the users in the following format.

Position: firstName lastName | DOB
