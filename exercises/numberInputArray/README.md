Problem #2 from LearnCPP Chapter 11.2

Ask the user for a number between 1 and 9. If the user does not enter a number between 1 and 9, repeatedly ask for an integer value until they do. If the user enters a number followed by extraneous input, ignore the extraneous input. Once they have entered a number between 1 and 9, print the array. Then search the array for the value that the user entered and print the index of that element.
